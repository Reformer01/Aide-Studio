# **App Name**: Grid Motion

## Core Features:

- Animated Grid Rendering: Renders an animated grid pattern using SVG and Framer Motion.
- Dynamic Resizing: Dynamically adjusts the grid dimensions based on the container size using a ResizeObserver.
- Individual Square Animation: Controls the animation of individual squares within the grid, including opacity and position changes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#90AFC5) to create a calm and unobtrusive background presence.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4F8), almost white, complementing the primary color.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#D98880) for interactive elements or subtle highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, suitable for both headlines and body text due to its modern and neutral look.
- Ensure the grid pattern adapts fluidly to different screen sizes, maintaining its visual integrity.
- Implement subtle, smooth transitions for the grid squares to avoid a jarring or distracting effect.
